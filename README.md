# Flight Delays Visualization
An almost inevitable part of modern travel, flight delays have become a growing problem in every individual's life as the world becomes more connected. This visualization attempts to find the best airline/airport/times to fly by examining their effects on the number of flight delays. The visualization shows that larger airports and early morning flights (6 to 8 am) have proportionally fewer delays. In addition, Virgin America has the fewest delays of all the airlines. This project is a group assignment for the CMSC 23900 course at the University of Chicago and the repository is forked from my project partner's account.

## Setup

After installing node/npm/yarn:

```sh
npm install
# then
npm run start

# or if using yarn
yarn
# then
yarn start
```
